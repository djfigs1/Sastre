An automatic resume builder for me!

## me.yaml format
The `me.yaml` file contains all of your information and experiences that can be put in your resume. The file is structured as follows:

```yaml
# The Me section defines your name and all of your contact info.
# The only required key in Me is your name with the Name key. You can decide
# everything else you want to include with a custom key and its string value. 
Me:
  Name: "Your Name Here" # REQUIRED!
  MyPhoneNumber: 123-456-7890
  MyGitHub: https://github.com/djfigs1
  # etc...

# The Sections object defines all of your resume sections. Each section can have
# a top-level description and accompanying subsections. 
# For all sections and subsections, the key of the section/subsection is used as
# the title unless specified otherwise.
Sections:
